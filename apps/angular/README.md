# Chess - Angular Implementation

An enterprise-grade Angular implementation showcasing dependency injection, services, and reactive programming with RxJS.

## Overview

This implementation demonstrates Angular best practices including services, dependency injection, RxJS for reactive programming, and TypeScript throughout.

## Features

- **Angular 17**: Latest Angular with standalone components
- **TypeScript**: Enterprise-grade type safety
- **RxJS**: Reactive programming for async operations
- **Services**: Business logic separation
- **Dependency Injection**: Flexible architecture
- **Angular CLI**: Complete toolchain

## Getting Started

```bash
cd apps/angular
npm install
ng serve --port 3005
```

Visit <http://localhost:3005>

## Key Angular Concepts Demonstrated

- **Services** for business logic
- **Dependency Injection** for flexible architecture
- **RxJS Observables** for reactive programming
- **Component lifecycle** hooks
- **Reactive forms** for user input
- **HTTP client** for API communication
