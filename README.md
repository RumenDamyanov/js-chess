Multi-framework chess UI demos powered by the Go backend. A shared design system in `shared/styles` keeps visuals consistent across implementations.

## üîÑ Current Status (Aug 2025)

Active & stable (included in default Docker / Make builds):

- Landing Page (overview + navigation)
- Vanilla JS
- Vanilla TypeScript
- jQuery
- Vue 3

Work‚Äëin‚Äëprogress (excluded by default ‚Äì manual start/build only):

- Angular (planned ‚Äì WIP)
- React (planned ‚Äì WIP)

These two WIP apps are intentionally disabled in aggregate Make targets to speed builds. They will return after framework‚Äëspecific rewrites that align with recent backend changes (improved move validation, AI workflow, and forthcoming caching / optimistic update layer).

## ‚ú® Recent Updates

Latest notable changes (since mid‚Äë2025):

1. Angular rewrite: promotion modal UI, castling handling, SAN move history, AI auto‚Äëmove flow, safer undo via replay, self‚Äëcapture & illegal move guards.
2. Unified WIP labeling: Landing page & all active headers show disabled (grey) links for Angular / React.
3. Makefile optimization: Default `build`, `up`, `rebuild`, `health`, `logs-frontend`, etc. now exclude Angular / React (use `start-angular`, `build-react`, etc. individually). Vue is included.
4. Promotion & castling UX: Consistent notation capture and server‚Äëvalidated sequencing.
5. Shared styling: Added disabled navigation/link styles and WIP tag classes.

Planned next steps for the WIP frameworks:

- Introduce a thin shared API client with response caching & diff reconciliation.
- Implement lightweight state stores (Signals / Zustand pattern equivalents) for faster replays.
- Add incremental board rendering & piece move animation.
- Re‚Äëenable once parity with stable implementations is verified via test checklist.

## Frameworks

Stable: Vanilla JS ¬∑ Vanilla TS ¬∑ jQuery ¬∑ Vue 3

WIP (temporarily disabled in default build): React ¬∑ Angular

docker/               # Container & proxy configs
Makefile              # Convenience targets
```

## Key Features

- Complete chess rules (promotion, castling, en passant)
- AI move generation + optional AI chat
- WebSocket live updates
- Move history & analysis hooks
- Light/Dark theme (CSS variables + toggle)

## Theming & Shared Styles

- Source of truth: `shared/styles/tokens.css`
- Dark overrides: `[data-theme="dark"]`
- Runtime path in containers: `/shared/styles/*`
- HTML references: `shared/styles/tokens.css`
- Toggle: `JSChessTheme.toggle()` (persists via `localStorage`)

Add new tokens or component CSS in `shared/styles` and rebuild images; all static apps pick up changes automatically. Future preprocessing (PostCSS/Sass) can hook into the placeholder Make target `build-shared-styles`.

## Quick Start (Docker ‚Äì Active Set Only)

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RumenDamyanov/js-chess.git
cd js-chess
make install          # Build & start backend + stable frontends
make urls             # List service URLs (WIP flagged as disabled)
```

Primary active ports: 3000 (landing) ¬∑ 3001 (vanilla JS) ¬∑ 3002 (vanilla TS) ¬∑ 3003 (jQuery) ¬∑ 3004 (Vue) ¬∑ 8080 (API)

WIP (manual if needed): 3005 (react) ¬∑ 3006 (angular)

## Make Targets (selection)

```bash
make up / down              # Start / stop active set only
make build / rebuild        # Build / rebuild active set only
make status / logs          # Container status / aggregated logs
make start-vanilla          # Start one app
make build-vanilla-ts       # Build TS vanilla image
make build-shared-styles    # Placeholder (no-op)
make start-angular          # (WIP) Start angular only
make build-react            # (WIP) Build react only
make build-vue              # Build vue only
```

## Local (no Docker)

```bash
npm run install:all
npm run start:backend
npm run start:vanilla   # or any start:* script
```

## Core API Endpoints

```text
POST /api/games               # New game
GET  /api/games/{id}          # State
POST /api/games/{id}/moves    # Player move
POST /api/games/{id}/ai-move  # AI move
WS   /ws/games/{id}           # Live updates
```

‚≠ê Star the repo if this multi-framework comparison helps you!

| **jQuery** | Classic event handling | None | Familiar, rapid development |
| **Vue.js** | Reactive components | Vite | Progressive enhancement |
| **React.js** | Component architecture | Vite | Modern hooks, state management |
| **Angular** | Enterprise features | Angular CLI | TypeScript, dependency injection |

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

The project includes a complete Docker setup with:

- **Backend API**: go-chess server running on port 8080
- **Frontend Apps**: Each app served on different ports (3000-3006)
- **Nginx Proxy**: Reverse proxy routing to different apps
- **Development Mode**: Hot reload for all frameworks

### WIP Framework Access (Optional)

These are disabled in aggregate commands. To experiment locally:

```bash
make start-angular   # Starts angular only (port 3006)
make start-react     # Starts react only (port 3005)
make start-vue       # Starts vue only (port 3004)
```

Expect partial / outdated UX until rewrites land.

## üé® Theming & Shared Styles

Unified theming is implemented via CSS Custom Properties in `shared/styles/tokens.css` with a light theme under `:root` and a dark theme scope using `[data-theme="dark"]`. Frontend apps load the same files so visual consistency is guaranteed.

Runtime path expectations inside Docker containers:

- All shared styles are copied to `/usr/share/nginx/html/shared/styles/`
- HTML references use relative paths like `shared/styles/tokens.css`

Add new design tokens or component styles in the shared directory; all static apps will receive them on the next image rebuild. If a preprocessing pipeline (PostCSS/Sass) is introduced, the placeholder Make target `build-shared-styles` can be extended.

Dark mode can be toggled with the button that calls `JSChessTheme.toggle()` (implemented in `theme-toggle.js`) which persists the user preference in `localStorage`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Make Commands
